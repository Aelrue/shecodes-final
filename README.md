This is a landing page describing the benefits of raw feeding for carnivorous cats and dogs. It offers a space for user interaction in the form of prompts and links users to other sites for more information.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript elements, and finished in April of 2022. Many thanks to SheCodes for introducing me to coding and giving me the skills to design this page.
